Hi, 
My name is Rafal Kaczmarczyk and welcome to my profile. 
Here I have presented the projects that I have redesigned and continue to do in my learning. 
I focus on the frontend because I'm interested in the visual aspects of the pages and how my code affects the overall look of the websites.

Rzedzian/Rzedzian is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
